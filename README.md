# Speech Recognition System
Overview
This project is a speech recognition system built using Python's speech_recognition library and Google's Web Speech API. The system converts spoken language into text, providing an interactive and efficient way to handle speech-to-text conversion. The system also integrates text-to-speech functionality to provide auditory feedback to users.

# Features
High Accuracy: Utilizes Google Web Speech API for accurate speech recognition.
Ambient Noise Adjustment: Dynamically adjusts to ambient noise for better recognition.
Text-to-Speech Feedback: Provides auditory feedback using the pyttsx3 library.
Multiple Attempt Handling: Ensures reliable recognition by allowing multiple attempts to capture speech.
